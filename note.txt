Dear Mr. Dewey,

    Thank you so much for a fantastic semester. I always laughed after the tests because I felt like I
didn't understand, yet I did well. After making this card, I finally see that the reason I did well
is because I actually understand programming. I don't know how you managed to teach a second semester
senior so well, but I can't thank you enough. I know that programming will be a skill that will be
incredibly useful for me, and I'm so glad that I have a basic understanding of how it works.

    As a second semester senior, I was certainly reluctant to put in extra effort. I was definitely
uncharacteristically loud and relaxed during your class, and I attribute some of that to my current
position, but I realize that this change in my attitude was mostly unique to your class. Ultimately,
I believe that it was because I was genuinely comfortable and happy during programming. You made class
interesting and fun. It was a special experience because it was so much more than I could have ever
asked for. We talked not only about programming, but about life. Being in your class was so much more
valuable than simply learning how to program.

    I couldn't write a thank you note without thanking you for putting up with me this whole semester.
All the times when I was off-topic, not in the mood to program or just clearly not in the mood to work
at all, you understood. I have never had a teacher who I feel understands me the way you understand me.
What truly amazes me though is that you're on that level with not just me, but all your students. It
makes the class worthwhile for every single student, so I know I say this on behalf of everyone:

Thank you so so much, Mr. Dewey.

Jake :)
